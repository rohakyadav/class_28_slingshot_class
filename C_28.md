## Topic: Slingshot

Objectives: -

1. Create a slingshot effect in the Angry Birds game. 
2. Learn to use the mouse trigger events like mouseDragged and mouseReleased.

### Steps:

1. ##### git clone the project for this class.

   git clone https://github.com/whitehatjr/AngryBirdsStage3 

   Last class ------  a **log attached to the bird**. So there were two bodies which were moving together. But in our game of Angry Birds, we want to **launch the Angry Birds from a fixed Point**.

   - We had created the **Chain class** last time around. The chain object created using this class was used to tie the bird and the log in a constraint.

     

2. Let's **modify this class** and make it a **SlingShot class**. 

   - Modifiy the Chain in the Chain.js file to Slingshot. 
   - Rename the file to Slingshot.js 
   - Modifies the index.html file to include 'Slingshot.js'

3. We are using **two bodies - bodyA and bodyB**. 

   - [ ] We don't want the bird body to be attached to any other body.

   - [ ]  Rather, we want it to be attached to and projected **from a point**. 

   - [ ] Let's look at the documentation and Check  option in the Matter.Constraint.

   - [ ]  We can just specify pointB instead of bodyB and the body will be constrained from that point. 

   - [ ] Modify the Slingshot class to include pointB everywhere in the code. 

   - [ ] Also change the script.js file to change Chain to Slingshot.

   - [ ] Pass the coordinates of a point as one of the parameters to the Slingshot() constructor.

   - [ ]  The coordinates can be anywhere you want the slingshot to appear.

   

4. The Bird is constrained to a point now. 

   * But we want the bird to fly and launch itself like a projectile when we release the mouse button. 

   * Also, we don't want the bird to always move. We want it to move only when we are dragging the mouse. How do we do that? Any ideas?
   * The bird is moving everywhere with the mouse because of what we have instructed in the Bird Class. Let's comment this instruction.Now, our bird doesn't move with the mouse. 
   * However. we want the mouse to move when the mouse is dragged on the bird. We will use a **function called mouseDragged** for this. This function mouseDragged gets invoked whenever you drag the mouse. When we drag the mouse, we will set the **position of the bird** to be equal to **mouseX** and **mouseY**. We use **Matter.body.setPosition()** to set the position of the bird body.
   * When we release the mouse it moves to and fro but is still connected to the point. We now just want to make the bird fly and **detach** it from the constraint when the mouse is released. We will give instructions inside another function called **mouseReleased()**. This function is also called when the mouse is released. For now, let's simply call slingshot.fly() inside this function. We haven't defined slingshot.fly() but we will.
   * **Define** slingshot.fly inside the Slingshot class. We will just change the bodyA to null. 'null' implies nothing in javascript. Earlier the bodyA was the bird. Attaching nothing to bodyA will free the bird from the constraint.

5. Something weird is happening, everything stops when we are releasing the mouse. 

   * Check the error by pressing **Ctrl + Shift + J** in our chrome browser.
   * It seems that even when the bodyA has become null, we are trying to access its position inside display. We only want to use the display() function in slingshot if the bodyA is not null. We can use if() condition here. 'null' evaluates to false.
   * We have bird sling ready.

6. We need to add the image of the catapult and show the catapult rubber getting extended. ( Next class + Catapult)
